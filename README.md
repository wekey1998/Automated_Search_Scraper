# Automated_Search_Scraper
This Python script automates Google searches for a list of items stored in an Excel file. It extracts the top 15 search results, including titles, links, and snippets, and saves them to an output Excel file. The script also checks if the retrieved links match specified base URLs and excludes results containing unwanted keywords.
